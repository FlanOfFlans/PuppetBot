# PuppetBot

A remote-control Discord "user" that will report back when pinged or PM'd.

## Getting Started

Create a new bot account for your puppet, and customize it as you wish. Then, configure PuppetConfig.txt, and run PuppetBot.py.

To use your puppet, you may use the following commands:

```
<prefix>say channel-name message
```

```
<prefix>pm "username with discriminator" message
```

Please note that the quotes around the username is NOT optional. The message can be as long as you want, up to Discord's limit, and may include spaces.

### Prerequisites

PuppetBot requires Python 3.4.2+, and [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

You can find the latest Python download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

To install discord.py, open your terminal (cmd on Windows), and type:

```
python3 -m pip install discord

```

This should automatically handle all prerequisites for discord.py as well.
