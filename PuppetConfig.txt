#This is a config file for a PuppetBot.
#Pound signs mark comments; these do nothing but provide information.
#Commands are separated from data with a colon (:)
#Valid config commands:

#server:[SERVER_ID] - Sets home server. Must be a server the bot is in.
#home_channel:[CHANNEL_ID] - Sets home channel. Must be a channel in home server the bot has access to.
#master:[MASTER_ID] - Adds this user as a puppet master, allowing them to control the bot. There can be multiple.
#ignore:[IGNORE_ID] - Ignores this user's pings. Cannot be a puppet master.
#prefix:[PREFIX] - Sets this as the prefix for commanding the bot. If not set, "pb!" will be used instead. A colon cannot be used in the prefix.
#token:[TOKEN] - Uses this token to run the bot. To get a token, go to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/, sign in, hit new application, customize the name and avatar of your puppet, go to the Bot tab, press "Add Bot", and copy the token.

#Anything else WILL cause a crash.
#To find IDs, in Discord, go to user settings > appearance, and enable developer mode. Right click the thing you want an ID for, and press Copy ID.
#WARNING: If using multiple PuppetBot instances, set them to ignore each other; an attacker may cause them to ping each other infinitely if you don't.
